A work in progress - but it does work.
The project uses just a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) and a 16 port 4067 multiplexer.
Thanks to Jack Wildchurch for the usability emphasis!

Currently - 
2 selectable patterns at a pot selected tempo.

16th's pattern length.

LED BPM indicator.

Live mode and Record mode. 

All 11 TR-909 sounds at 44.1kHz.

Beat delete, by pressing the same input button at a location as pressed to enable it.

Swing - crudimentarily implemented with a pot for now. Intention is to follow Roger Linn's % method.
MIDI to follow, being worked on for MIDI In and MIDI Out.

81% prog memory used - other old skool drumkits are intended to be able to be used in a future update.

Fritzing or similar schematic to be uploaded.

Code is commented.
