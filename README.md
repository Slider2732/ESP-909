A work in progress - but it does work.
The project uses just a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) and a 16 port 4067 multiplexer.
Thanks to Jack Wildchurch for the usability emphasis!

Currently - <br>
2 different user creatable patterns at a pot selected tempo <br>
16th's pattern length <br>
Live mode and Record mode  <br>
LED BPM and Live mode indicator <br>
Play/Pause button <br>
Easy pattern swap button (on right side end of drum buttons) <br>
All 11 TR-909 sounds at 44.1kHz <br>
Beat delete, by pressing the same input button at a location as pressed to enable it <br>
Swing - crudimentarily implemented with a pot for now. Intention is to follow Roger Linn's % method <br>
MIDI to follow, being worked on for MIDI In and MIDI Out <br>
81% prog memory used - other old skool drumkits are intended to be able to be used in a future update <br>

Fritzing or similar schematic to be uploaded. <br>
Code is commented. <br>
